Assignment 1
This assignment is adopted from Project Euler Question 13. 

Requirement
- use file for the input (nums.txt)
- use int array(s) (size: 55) to hold each digit from each num.
- store the num reversely in the array. For example, the num 123 is stored as 3 (at index 0), 2 (at index 1) and 1 (at index 2) in the array. 
- write a function that performs the addition of numbers. This function will be called in the main. 
- write a function that prints out the answer. The answer includes two parts: the total summation and the first 10 digits of the summation. 
- comment the code clearly, especially for the number addition mechanism. 

Grading
- compilable and meaningful attemps: 30 points. That is, the code must be compilable while it cannot be just a compilable hello world. 
- functionality: 40 points. (file, string number handling, array and addition mechanism, answer printing)
- comment & indentation: 10 points. 
- explanation to lab TA: 20 points. You need to explain the array and addition mechanism to one of the lab TAs, either in the lab time, in their office hours or setup an appointment. 
- Total score: 30 + 40 + 10 + 20 = 100 points. 

Submission:
- due: feb 15, 11:59pm
- please submit through handin program.


Notes:

for( ) // for handling 100 numbers
{
  1) read a line from the file using getline(in, str);
  2) str -> individual digits, string[0] to get digit
  3) store the sum line by line in the array, then print out the first ten digits of summation, and the summation itself
}
