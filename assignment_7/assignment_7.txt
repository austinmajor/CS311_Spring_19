CS 311 Assignment #7
Define a class called StringSet that will be used to store a set of strings. Use a vector to store the strings.
All strings in the set must be unique (i.e., no duplicates).

Requirement:
- constructor: an empty constructor.
- constructor: a constructor that takes in a string array (and its size), use the values inside array to initialize the StringSet object.
- constructor: a constructor that takes in a string vector, use the values inside vector to initialize the StringSet object.
- member function: void add(string str), which adds str to the set.
- member function: void remove(string str), which removes str from the set.
- member function: void clear(), which clears all string sfrom the set.
- member function: int size(), which returns the count of number of strings in the set.
- member function: void union(const StringSet& ss), which unions with strings in ss.
- member function: void intersect(const StringSet& ss), which intersects with strings in ss.
- member function: void print(), which prints all strings in the set.
- main(): test all constructors and member functions in main().
- makefile: provide makefile for your solution
- separate interface(.h) and implementation(.cpp)

File structures and names:
- stringset.h: class StringSet interface
- stringset.cpp: class StringSet implementation
- test.cpp: contains main() and tests all constructors and member functions.
- makefile: contains compile instructions for make.

Grading:
- compilable and meaningfull attemps: 20%
- StringSet class: 50%
- test and main(): 20%
- comment, indentation and file names and makefile: 10%
