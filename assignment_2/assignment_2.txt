Assignment 2
Rock-Scissor-Paper & Tic-Tac-Toe

R-S-P Requirement: 
- write one program that mimics the Rock-Scissor-Paper game. This program will ask user to enter an input (out of R-S-P), and the computer will randomly pick one and print out the result (user wins / computer wins). 
- User's input along with computer's random pick will be encoded in the following format:
-- user's rock: 	10
-- user's scissor: 	20
-- user's paper: 	30
-- comp's rock:		1
-- comp's scissor: 	2
-- comp's paper: 	3
Then add user's input and computer's pick toghter to for a summation, and use switch statement over the summation to tell the result. For example, 12 (10 + 2: u's rock and c's scissor, user wins), 33 (30 + 3: u's paper and c's paper, draw). 

T-T-T Requirement: 
- write one program that uses two dimensional array to allow two players to play tic-tac-toe. The program asks for moves alternately from player X and player O to enter a number (1 - 9) they wish to makr to play the game.The program displays the game positions as follows: 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
After each move, the program displays the changed board, for example: 
X X O
4 5 6
O 8 9
- the program should have following functions: 
-- a function to take in user's input. 
-- a function to print out the board and move. 
-- a function to tell if game is over. 
-- a function to tell who wins (or draw.)


Grading
- program 1: 40 points; program 2: 60 points. 
- no explanation required.  (we will do so on assignment 3).
- in each program: 
-- compilable and meaningful attemps: 30%
-- functionality: 60%
-- comment & indentation: 10%
-- using the required file name: 20% 

File name: 
- rsp.cpp for the first program
- ttt.cpp for the second program
