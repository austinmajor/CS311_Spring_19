CS 311 Assignment #5
Rational number class

Define a class for rational numbers. A rational number is a "ratio-nal" number, composed of two integers with division indicated.

Requirement:
- two member variables: (int) numerator and (int) denominator.
- two constructors: one that takes in both numerator and denominator to construct a rational number, and one that takes in only numerator and initialize the denominator as 1.
- accessor/modifier
- member functions: add(), sub(), mul(), div(), and less(). Usage: to add rational num b and rational num a, one could call a.add(b); to compare rational num a and rational num b, one could call a.less(b). add(), sub(), mul() and div() should return a rational number.
- member functon: factor(). This function should be a private function that should be called each time numerator/denominator is set/modified. The purpose of this function is to take the greatest common factor out of numerator/denominator. For example, rational number 2/4 should be stored as 1/2, rational number 3/9 should be stored as 1/3.
- fully test all public functions inside main().
